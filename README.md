# Student-Profile-Management-System

The Student Profile Management System is designed for educational institutions to efficiently manage student records. This system overcomes the limitations of manual record-keeping, such as data scattering, redundancy, and time-consuming retrieval. Students can register and log in to view and update their profiles, provided their ID and name are in the administration database. The platform also provides access to departmental and general notices, semester results, and top CGPA results within departments. Additionally, it allows other institution members to view general notices, which the administration can modify as needed.
